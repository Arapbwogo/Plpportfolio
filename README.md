# Myportfolio
This is the very first program of me.
It shows:
i). The moves i have made to introduce myself to programming languages expecially the frontend ones.
ii). The everyday knowledge added to my brain either through learning or being taught.
iii). Where i have weaknesses and whoever notices can help me correct or strengthen it.
